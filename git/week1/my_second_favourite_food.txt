How to make Masala Khichia Recipe (Spicy Corn Flour Papad):

To begin making the Spicy Masala Khichia recipe, firstly, sieve the corn flour and keep it side.

Next, in a saucepan boil the water for double as compare to the flour.

When the water comes to a boil, add green chilli paste, red chilli powder, salt, cumin seeds, salt, ajwain, papad khar and mix well.

Add two teaspoon of mustard oil in the water mixture and mix it properly.

When water is properly hot add corn flour little by little and mix well. Stir it continuously to avoid lumps in the mixture.

When water is absorbed, cover it with lid and steam it. Now switch off the flame and again mix the dough and keep it aside for 5 minutes.

Make small balls in round shape out of it and keep it between two plastic sheets.

Keep it on a rolling board and press it with another rolling board or any heavy plate to form a flat roti. You can even make it in a papad machine.

Now take out the plastic sheet and leave this papad on the cloth. Keep in the sun for 2 days. When papad is properly dry then store in airtight container.

Now, spread the vegetable mixture on the khichia and garnish it with chopped green coriander. You can also use sev to garnish the same.
